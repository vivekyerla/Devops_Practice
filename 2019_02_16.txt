DEVOPS INTRODUCTION

What is DevOps 
- Operations concept in development
- Automation of most of the SDLC stages 

Tools in DevOps
- Configuration management tools - Ansible, Chef
- CICD tools - Jenkins
- Orchestration tools - CloudFormation, Terraform
- Containers - Docker, Kubernetes
- Scripting language - Python
- Monitoring tools - Nacho
- Widgets - SonarQube, Nexus
- Source Code Management tool - GitHub (GitHub is server, GitBash is client)

Why demand for DevOps
- Reduce overall cost 
- Increase efficiency
- Example: A Generic problem statement could be - Scale Peta-bytes of data at all levels in a Big Data project
	- You need skilled DevOps engineer to handle such problem

Note:
- Sir will upload our daily work on Google Classroom 
- We will upload our daily work on GitHub for backup

DIFFERENT CLOUD SERVICE OFFERINGS

AWS-Demo PPT slide no. 5

Different layers of a shippable software product:
- Hardware
- Storage
- Networking
- Virtualization
- Operating System
- Runtime Environment
- Actual Application
- Functions of Applications that can be executed on Command Line / Rest API / GUI / Programming Language. This is what is used in Micro Services.

Different Cloud Service Models:
- On Premise
- IaaS
- Paas
- FaaS
- SaaS

IaaS activities: (Ansible, Chef)
- provisioning
- configuration management
- deployment
- monitoring
- security

PaaS .. you get readymade Docker image with all pre-requisite libraries pre-installed  .. could be JVM image 
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- EBS (Elastic Beanstalk) ... EBS for Elastic Block Storage (hard disk of EC2 instance) is different
- EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes)

PaaS vs. FaaS:
- In PaaS, You need to write code, create container and deploy container and create rest API end point
- In FaaS, You need to write code, and create rest API end point. Containerization will be managed by cloud. Just focus on code and function.

SaaS
- In SaaS, you use software as a service and pay for what you use. You do not deal with code etc.

For any problem statement, 
- You first identify, what is the type of your application is - On-Premise / IaaS / PaaS / FaaS / SaaS
- What are the concerns/requirements of customer
- Provide different possible solutions with approx. costing

AWS 10000 FEET OVERVIEW

AWS infrastructure (Hardware layer of slide 5) is divided in 3 parts:
- Region
- Availability Locations (data center)
- Edge locations
- slide 6

CloudFront (CF)
- Amazon's content delivery network (CDN)
- slide 7

VPC
- application server, db server in private network - one layer
- web server, load balancers in public network - another layer

Route53 
- domain name to IP address or IP address to domain name resolution
- can be used for public IP or internal IP resolution

Compute:
- In IaaS, you need EC2 instance (EC2 = Elastic Cloud Compute)
- In PaaS, you need ECS Docker Containers (ECS = Elastic Container Service), EBS (EBS = Elastic Beanstalk)
- In FaaS, you need Lambda function (server-less, event driven program)

ECS vs. EBS:
- Docker is another company .. ECS allows to integrate(deploy) your docker images with AWS 
- EBS (Elastic Beanstalk) is Amazon's Docker ... ECS is more popular than EBS
- EBS also stands for Elastic Block Storage which is hard disk of an EC2 instance 

S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Use bucket for storing all files needed for application (csv, json etc.)

Storage Gateway 
- helps to uploads your files from organization to AWS cloud

EFS (Elastic File System)
- Shared File system mounted on your Linux machine
- EFS is native ... S3 is online

Note:
- Co-relate your daily assignments to these AWS services
- Go through YouTube video - How to create Linux EC2 and SSH to it
- Next class, we will see Basic Linux commands
- Bogo to bogo - Read Linux material ... Devops interview starts with Linux

Interview stages
- Linux
- Configuration Management  Ansible, CICD
- Scripting / Java
- Cloud - AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- MicroServices
